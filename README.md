# HackACM_Mar_3_2018
A Repository for Mar 3 2018's HackACM by UCSC

The project is an academic planner, mainly to help undergraduates organize their academic curriculum chart.
Because the planner existing now is not easy for undergraduates to create a full academic plan,
while there are only curriculum charts for Majors/Minors,
I have an idea to build such a project to help students create a **full academic plan**, including Major courses,
General Education courses, and courses that students prefer to take.
